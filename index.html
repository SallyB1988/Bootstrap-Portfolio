              <p >I spent the first 18 years of my life in Bethesda, MD. Then I moved to Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. After graduating, I got married and moved to Dayton, OH. At that point, I realized that although I had lived in three different states - I always managed to remain in Montgomery County.
              </p>
              <p >My husband's job in the Air Force took us to various places in the US, but Albuquerque, NM was by far my favorite. I prefer a small town over a large city, and I like warm weather, so it met my general requirements for where I enjoy living. But what I really enjoyed about the area was the food (they put green chilis in pretty much everything - an it always seems to improve the taste!), learning about the Native American culture, and that it was so easy to visit some amazing National Parks over a long weekend. Another benefit of living there is that I finally learned how to spell 'Albuquerque'!
              </p>
              <p >I enjoy a wide variety of activities. The homemaker side of me enjoys quilting, reading, flower arranging and baking - I have been told I make very good pies! The nerd side of me enjoys doing puzzles and writing code. I love learning new skills and the sense of accomplishment I get when I struggle with something and then finally figure it out!
